Device Tree Clock bindings for brcmstb

In addition to the platform bindings provided in-tree, the brcmstb common
clock driver supports the following clock providers/consumers:

	- CPU clock dividers (provider/consumer)

=== CPU clock divider ===

The CPU divider node serves as the sole clock for the CPU complex. It supports
power-of-2 clock division, with a divider of "1" as the default highest-speed
setting.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"brcm,brcmstb-cpu-clk-div"
- reg : address and width of the divider configuration register
- #clock-cells : shall be set to 0
- clocks : phandle of clock provider which provides the source clock
	   (this would typically be a "fixed-clock" type PLL)
- div-table : list of (raw_value,divider) ordered pairs that correspond to the
	      allowed clock divider settings
- div-shift-width : least-significant bit position and width of divider value

example:
	cpupll: cpupll@0 {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <1500000000>;
	};

	cpuclk: cpu-clk-div@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-cpu-clk-div";
		reg = <0xf03e257c 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&cpupll>;
		div-table = <0x00 1 0x11 2 0x12 4 0x13 8 0x14 16>;
		div-shift-width = <0 5>;
	};

	cpus {
		cpu@0 {
			clocks = <&cpuclk>;
		};
	};
